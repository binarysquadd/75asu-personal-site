## Hey, I’m Asutosh

I’m a SRE with a strong backend foundation, currently working remotely with a US-based team.  
I focus on building **reliable infrastructure, secure systems, and automation that scales without drama**.

I’ve spent the last 5+ years designing, migrating, and operating production systems — from Kubernetes clusters and CI/CD pipelines to security tooling and internal platforms.

## What I Work With

- **Infrastructure & Platforms**  
  Kubernetes, Docker, FluxCD, KubeOne, Hetzner & OVH bare-metal, SOPS, 1Password

- **CI/CD & Automation**  
  GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, ARC runners, large-scale repo migrations

- **Observability & Reliability**  
  Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager, BetterStack
