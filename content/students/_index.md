A small record of classrooms, winters, and students I crossed paths with.

## College

### Winter 2024 – Feb 2025  
BSc Computer Science — Final Year  

Spent the winter with a final-year batch, talking about full stack engineering, interviews, and what comes after college.

### Winter 2023 – Feb 2024  
BSc Computer Science — Final Year  

Another winter, another classroom. Long sessions, questions that went beyond the syllabus, and a lot of placement anxiety mixed with excitement.

## Tuition

### 2017 – 2020  
Class 9 & 10  

These were the years before everything went remote.  
Evenings filled with notebooks, revisions, and the quiet routine of showing up every day.

#### 2017 10th Batch
